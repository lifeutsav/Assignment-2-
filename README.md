## Setup
1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/lifeutsav/Assignment-2-.git
   cd Assignment-2-

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # macOS / Linux
   # or
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1  # Windows PowerShell

3. Install dependencies (if any):

   If there is a requirements.txt file, run:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## How to run
- If the submission is a script, run:

  python <script_name>.py

- If it is a module or package, follow the run instructions provided in the file headers or add them here.

## Testing
- If tests are included, run:

  pytest -q

## Style & Linting
Suggested tools to keep code clean:

- black .
- flake8 .
- mypy .

## What I checked
- A commit titled "Add files via upload" exists (2025-09-02). Two files were uploaded in that commit.
- I couldn't automatically retrieve the file contents while creating this README; please update the Contents section with the actual filenames and short descriptions.

## Recommended next steps
1. Update this README with the actual filenames and a short description for each file.
2. Add a requirements.txt if the project has external dependencies: pip freeze > requirements.txt
3. Add simple run examples and expected outputs so reviewers can verify the submission quickly.
4. Add a small test (pytest) that demonstrates the main functionality.
